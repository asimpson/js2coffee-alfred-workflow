js2coffee-alfred-workflow
=========================

An Alfred workflow that converts javascript to coffeescript.

##Requirements
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Alfred Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) & [Alfred v2](http://www.alfredapp.com/)

This workflow smooths out those rough moments where you need to integrate a snippet of JS from Stackoverflow or pull down an options block from a Grunt plugin. Simply copy the JS you want and the workflow converts the JS on your clipboard to Coffeescript. Easy.
